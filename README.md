<h3 align="center">👋 Hello! I'm Enzo Politi</h3>
<p align="center">
I'm a super curious guy, self-taught, motivated, and passionate about new technologies.
Working on previous projects, I learned how to organize the structure of large-scale data-rich web apps with good user experience and mobile-responsive.
So far, I've worked side by side with team members, from startups as well as big companies, both in an agile environment and coming up with creative and innovative ideas to build better web apps.
